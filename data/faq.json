    "question": "What is online learning like",
    "answer": "For those who have never encountered online learning, the biggest question is often what it is actually like. The caveat, as you know, is that online learning comes in several forms. Therefore, this is your chance to explain that to people. Point out that there are different types of online courses and programs, and that they’ll have to decide which is best for them. Then, explain the types of courses you offer and how your online programs work to give them all the information they need. This not only gives them information, but it increases their trust because you’re being transparent and giving them straightforward answers."

    "question": "Are you accredited or licensed by educational organizations",
    "answer": "There isn’t always a need for licensing or accreditation for online courses. However, some programs do require it. Either way, people will usually ask what type of training or background you have, as well as any licensing that’s available if that’s relevant. Make sure that you answer this question by telling them if you do hold any licenses or accreditation, as well as by explaining whether or not those are needed, and why. It gives them the confidence that you have the right experience and boosts your credibility because you’re offering additional information for the sake of education alone. "

    "question": "Does online learning really work",
    "answer": "There’s always a skeptic, and when it comes to online learning, there are often several of them. Everyone wants to know if online courses “really work”—and that’s a hard question to answer because there are several factors to consider. On a general basis, yes, online learning can be effective. However, that depends on whether the courses are set up properly, the provider is educated and experienced, and if the person taking the courses does well in a virtual learning environment. You should be able to explain these things to people so that they know what they’re getting into. Then, you can invite them to contact you to discuss whether it would be right for them."

Depending on the type of online learning that you offer, your courses may have their own variable lengths. Explain to people the types of courses that you have available and what the time frame is for each one. If you offer self-paced learning, this is another place to reiterate that and reassure people that you can help them learn on their own time. It could also be helpful to link to your course catalog or course pages here so that people can see the exact specifications of the course(s) they are considering taking from your website. "

Either way, everyone is going to want to know how much online courses are going to cost. If you have a set list of prices, provide those here. You can also advise whether there are payment plans or financial assistance, or if you work with any type of student loan funding. This is also a great place to link to your pricing page or to course pages where you list the course requirements and costs, allowing people to further their research without having to find the information on their own.
